## Running in Local Environment for Development

**install python plugins and env**

Python installations are a beast. This worked for me on macOS with homebrew
enviroment. ymmv

```
$ pipx install mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin mkdocs-with-pdf --include-deps
$ source ~/.local/pipx/venvs/mkdocs-with-pdf/bin/activate
```

**run a dev server**

```
$ mkdocs serve
```
